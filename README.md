# 3D Embedding Visualizer

**3D Embedding Visualizer** is a Python Streamlit-based application for visualizing high-dimensional image and text embeddings in 3D using PCA, UMAP, and T-SNE. It provides an interactive interface to explore and understand embeddings from popular datasets and custom text.

This helps to quickly visualize and explore the structure of image and text embeddings in 3D, making it easier to understand relationships and patterns in your data. And also to compare various dimensionality reduction techniques, with each other.

## Features

- Visualize embeddings for both images (Iris, MNIST, Breast Cancer, Olivetti Faces) and custom text
- Choose between PCA, UMAP, and T-SNE for dimensionality reduction
- Interactive 3D scatter plots with Plotly
- Easy-to-use Streamlit interface
